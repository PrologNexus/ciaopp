@bf{How to use this @tt{interactive} document}:
@begin{itemize}
@item Some code boxes needs your interaction. You will identify them
  by a @bf{question mark} (@bf{?}) in the right top corner.
@item Your goal is turn all @em{question marks} boxes into 
  @bf{green checked marks} (@bf{âœ”}):
@begin{itemize}
  @item Boxes with a @bf{thinking face} (ðŸ¤”) are exercises that you
    must complete in order to progress. Once an exercise is completed,
    press the @em{question mark}.
  @item Boxes without the @em{thinking face} just needs pressing the
    @em{question mark}. They are editable so that you can play with them.
  @item Code errors or failed exercises turn into @bf{red erroneous
    mark} (@bf{âœ˜}). You can try again.
  @item When available, pressing the @bf{northeast pointing arrow}
    (@bf{â†—}) will load the code in a separate playground window.
@end{itemize}
@item Additionally, boxes with @bf{right-pointing triangles} (@bf{â–¶})
  allow interacting with the code loaded so far (as @em{queries}). In
  order to use them, @bf{make sure previous code boxes are checked}.
@end{itemize}
