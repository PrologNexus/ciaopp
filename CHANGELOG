CHANGELOG_CIAOPP
****************

Version/Change Log
==================

Version 1.3 (2019/11/3, 11:16:23 CEST)
        * New functionality:
             * Backported (and improved) incremental analysis (incanal)
               from CiaoPP 0.8.

             * Integrated incremental and modular analysis (`pp_flag
               incremental=on')

             * Integrated modular analysis in the general analysis
               driver.

             * Added analysis using run-time semantics of assertions to
               the `dd' fixpoint (`pp_flag' `old_trusts=off').

             * Fixes in meta-calls (work in progress).

             * Modularized domains, now they use the aidomain package
               (work in progress).

             * Added generic, non relational domain with simpler domain
               operations.

             * New flag value: restrict modular analysis to the modules
               of a bundle (`pp_flag' `punit_boundary=bundle').

        * Performance improvements:
             * Added hook to cache library assertions.

             * Added flag to load modules faster by preloading ciao
               libraries.

             * Fixed many dangling choicepoints across all modules.

             * Fixed performance issues in modular analysis.

             * Fixed bug of metacalls inside a recursion (`dd'
               fixpoint).

        * User interface and documentation:
             * Rearranged manual.

             * Created web interface for demos (see `ciaopp_online'
               bundle).

             * Added a high level interface for intermental analisis
               (incanal).

        * Benchmarks, internal testing, and debugging:
             * Tests/benchmarks moved to a separate bundle
               (ciaopp_tests).

             * Added tests for gitlab CI (continuous integration).

             * Some fixes in the davinci interface.

             * Fixed (documentation) assertions. CiaoPP can be run with
               the package rtchecks.

             * Added analysis_stats.pl to unify statistics collecting.

             * ciaopp-dump-cmp: new command to compare two ciaopp
               analaysis dumps.

             * ciaopp-dump-fmt: new command that outputs the analysis
               in dot format.

             * New flag value: Raw analysis printer (`pp_flag'
               `output_lang=raw').

             * Added `pp_flag' to trace fixpoints.

        * Other bug fixes, cleanups, refactoring, etc.:
             * Removed `api' (now using `p_unit').

             * Fixed maintaining `plai_db' for complete operations

             * Fixed classifying mistakenly recursive predicates as non
               recursive (meta predicates).

             * Fixed issue with reexported predicates in p_unit.

             * Fixed problem with meta_predicates that did not have any
               meta argument.

             * Added `free/1' to `sharefree_clique' domain.

             * Replaced `runtime_control:statistics/2' by
               `analysis_stats:pp_statistics/2'.

             * Using `p_unit/program_keys.pl' for the keys of ciaopp.
