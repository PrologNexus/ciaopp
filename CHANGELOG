Version/Change Log
==================

Version 1.4 (2020/11/18, 6:18:7 CET)
        * General changes and new features:
             * LLVM-based frontend improved and moved to its own bundle
               (see `ciaopp_llvm' bundle).

             * Split `typeslib' as a separate bundle.

             * Allow heads of entry assertions to be non-normalized.

             * Adapted to new hiord.

             * [new] Command `ciaopp-dump', which performs several
               actions over a ciaopp analysis dump: it subsumes the old
               `ciaopp-dump-cmp' and `ciaopp-dump-cmp' commands. New
               options for: showing the contents of a dump file, a code
               reachability report, static, offline checks of
               assertions using a dump file, and general statistics for
               the analysis results.

             * [new] Added `-op Suffix' option to ciaopp command-line
               (useful for flycheck).

             * [new] Warning if no entries were found

             * [new] Unified messages, now controlled by `ciaopp_log.pl'

             * [new] `ciaopp-batch' command to run ciaopp on many files
               and with timeouts.

             * [new] Modular (non-incremental) analysis with types
               (shortening).

             * [new] Bottom-up incremental update of fixpoint (at
               literal level).

             * [new] Modular (non-incremental) analysis with types
               (shortening).

        * Domains:
             * Implemented domains using (a special) trait package.

             * Added `needs/2' operation.

             * Renamed `abstypes_abs' to `auxinfo_asub'.

             * eterms: `member/2', `=/2' as native properties (for
               assertions).

             * pdb:
                  * Optimize `pdb_compute_lub': top if any `ASub' is
                    top.

                  * Use `fail' literals.

             * sharing: fixed `free/1' handlers

             * shfr: fixes in handlers of `==/2', `=/2', `'\=='/2',
               `'\='/2', `free/1' (native version of `var/1')

        * Fixpoints:
             * Split compilation options (`debug', `trace', `rtchecks')
               in common file `fixpoint_options.pl'

             * Improved tracing of clauses

             * Refactored fixpoints to make them easier to merge

        * Fixpoint `dd':
             * [fix] Reuse a complete with the same head but different
               vars order

             * [performance] Using get_memo_table because Id+Key is
               unique

             * [fix] Case in which a literal is not reachable

             * Improved documentation

        * Analysis of higher-order code:
             * [new] Flag for automatic generation of entries of meta
               calls.

             * [fix] `call/N' was not being detected as meta predicate
               (and flattened when possible).

             * [new] `\+' not treated as meta, flatten calls known at
               compile time.

        * Flags and options menu:
             * [new] Flag to remove useless (unreachable) completes
               after fixpo.

             * `punit_boundary': change default value to bundle.

             * Included `incanal' flag, changed `ext_policy' in menu
               (same as `pp_flag').

             * Improved options menu (added and simplified
               dependencies, simplified text, grouped actions, better
               documentation).

Version 1.3 (2019/11/3, 11:16:23 CEST)
        * New functionality:
             * Backported (and improved) incremental analysis (incanal)
               from CiaoPP 0.8.

             * Integrated incremental and modular analysis (`pp_flag
               incremental=on')

             * Integrated modular analysis in the general analysis
               driver.

             * Added analysis using run-time semantics of assertions to
               the `dd' fixpoint (`pp_flag' `old_trusts=off').

             * Fixes in meta-calls (work in progress).

             * Modularized domains, now they use the aidomain package
               (work in progress).

             * Added generic, non relational domain with simpler domain
               operations.

             * New flag value: restrict modular analysis to the modules
               of a bundle (`pp_flag' `punit_boundary=bundle').

        * Performance improvements:
             * Added hook to cache library assertions.

             * Added flag to load modules faster by preloading ciao
               libraries.

             * Fixed many dangling choicepoints across all modules.

             * Fixed performance issues in modular analysis.

             * Fixed bug of metacalls inside a recursion (`dd'
               fixpoint).

        * User interface and documentation:
             * Rearranged manual.

             * Created web interface for demos (see `ciaopp_online'
               bundle).

             * Added a high level interface for intermental analisis
               (incanal).

        * Benchmarks, internal testing, and debugging:
             * Tests/benchmarks moved to a separate bundle
               (ciaopp_tests).

             * Added tests for gitlab CI (continuous integration).

             * Some fixes in the davinci interface.

             * Fixed (documentation) assertions. CiaoPP can be run with
               the package rtchecks.

             * Added analysis_stats.pl to unify statistics collecting.

             * ciaopp-dump-cmp: new command to compare two ciaopp
               analaysis dumps.

             * ciaopp-dump-fmt: new command that outputs the analysis
               in dot format.

             * New flag value: Raw analysis printer (`pp_flag'
               `output_lang=raw').

             * Added `pp_flag' to trace fixpoints.

        * Other bug fixes, cleanups, refactoring, etc.:
             * Removed `api' (now using `p_unit').

             * Fixed maintaining `plai_db' for complete operations

             * Fixed classifying mistakenly recursive predicates as non
               recursive (meta predicates).

             * Fixed issue with reexported predicates in p_unit.

             * Fixed problem with meta_predicates that did not have any
               meta argument.

             * Added `free/1' to `sharefree_clique' domain.

             * Replaced `runtime_control:statistics/2' by
               `analysis_stats:pp_statistics/2'.

             * Using `p_unit/program_keys.pl' for the keys of ciaopp.
