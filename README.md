# The CiaoPP Program Processor

CiaoPP is a program processor framework for
[Ciao](https://github.com/ciao-lang/ciao). CiaoPP performs a number of
program debugging, analysis, and source-to-source transformation
tasks:

 - **Inference of properties** of the predicates and literals of the
   program (*types*, *modes* and other *variable instantiation*
   properties, *non-failure*, *determinacy*, bounds on *computational
   cost*, bounds on *sizes of terms* in the program, etc.).

 - Certain kinds of **static debugging** and **verification**, finding
   errors before running the program. This includes checking how
   programs call system library predicates and also *checking the
   assertions* present in the program or in other modules used by the
   program. Such assertions represent essentially partial
   *specifications* of the program.

 - Several kinds of source to source **program transformations** such
   as *program specialization*, *slicing*, *partial evaluation*,
   *program parallelization* (taking *granularity control* into
   account), inclusion of *run-time tests* for assertions which cannot
   be checked completely at compile-time, etc.

The information generated by analysis and the assertions in the
specifications are all written in the same *assertion language*, which
is in turn also used by the Ciao system documentation generator,
`lpdoc`.

This repository contains the generic preprocessor framework together
with some basic analyses, transformations, and language support. Other
features (including support for a variety of programming languages)
are distributed as separate bundles.
