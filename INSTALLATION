INSTALLATION_CIAOPP
*******************

The distribution of CiaoPP consists of its source files, written in the
Ciao language.  By default, Ciao will detect and build CiaoPP during
system compilation.  In order to customize the default configuration
options, please refer to the Ciao installation instructions.

It is possible to do a separate build and install of CiaoPP with the
following commands:

     $ ciao build ciaopp
     $ ciao install ciaopp

Among other things, those commands will:
  1. Create an executable 'ciaopp' that you can run under Unix.
  2. Create an executable 'ciaopp.bat' that you can run under Windows.
  3. Set up things so that you can use CiaoPP as a library module from,
     e.g., the Ciao shell.  In order to do this, please follow the
     (short) instructions that the installation prints out at the end
     when you run it.
